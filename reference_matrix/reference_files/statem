Motivation and Goals: 

My primary goal is to improve human health. I believe that the wealth of information that can now be captured by technological advances in functional genomics will require scientists with a background in computational and data science. By pursuing a PhD in biomedical informatics from UCSF, I feel that I will be uniquely equipped to pursue an academic career that will be interdisciplinary 


Statement of purpose: The focus of my research is to development of novel statistical and algorithmic tools in the diagonsis and prognosis of human disease. These tools will be used on large, high dimensional clinical datasets.
